/* As with status our program blocks until the child process is finished, and we get back three things; the status, the contents of stdout, and the contents of stderr. The captured output is simply 'Vec<u8>', just bytes. Recall that we have no guarantee that data we receive from the operating system is a properly encoded UTF-8 string. In fact, we have no guarantee that it even is a string; programs may return arbitrary binary data.

If we are sure the output is UTF-8, then 'String::from_utf8' will convert those vectors or bytes. It returns a 'Result' because this conversion may not succeed. A more sloppy function is 'String::from_utf8_lossy' which will make a good attempt at conversion and insert the invalid Unicode mark ï¿½ where it failed. */
