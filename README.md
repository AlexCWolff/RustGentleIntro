# Rust Gentle Intro

This started as my code along to [Rust Gentle Intro](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/readme.html) but ended up being a minor rewrite to improve the explanations and make the text flow more naturally (at least for me). A lot of this code will not compile since it's formatted for reading, not executing.
