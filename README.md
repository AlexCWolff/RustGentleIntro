# Rust Gentle Intro

This is my code along to [Rust Gentle Intro](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/readme.html). While the code is preserved I added comments to the code and rewrote some sections as comments to improve the explanations and make the text flow more naturally (at least for me).
